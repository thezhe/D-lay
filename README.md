# D-lay
A VST that models the mellow, distorted tones of traditional analog Bucket-Brigade Device ('BBD') delay effects. Written in the latest C++20 draft using the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com/).

**This is repo contains *depercated* code. Please refer to [my VA library](https://github.com/thezhe/SOUL-VA) for new effects and an updated BBD delay model in the future.**
